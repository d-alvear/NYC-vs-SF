# New York City vs. San Francisco: Which city is actually better?

This project is a refactoring of my old Coursera capstone project.

### To Do/Ideas:

* ~~find neighborhood data to partition each city into its neighborhoods~~
* ~~find median rent prices per neighborhood~~
* transportation counts with average wait times?
* venue data from Foursquare API
* percentage greenspace?
* quality of schools?
### Done

* cleaned rent data
